#Instructions for GIT
________
##How to Start
Firstly we have to initialize Git in the folder we work in. It means *"Creating Repository"*
 ?
 ##How to "Branch"
We can use different branches of Git to make kind of a *TreeView* of our repository. By the default we have one branch named "master"
To check where are we currently situated, we whould:
* Type **Git Branch** 

To reach the *TreeView* firstly we should make another branch, then we should:
* Type **Git Branch "*Branch_name*"**  

To switch to our brant new branch we should just:
* Type **Git checkout "*Branch_name*"**

And to start commiting here, do:
* Type **Git add *filename.xx*** 

then as usual

* Type **Git commit -m *"your message to commit"***- to finally create your commit in the branch
