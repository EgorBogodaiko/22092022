#Instructions for GIT
________
##How to Start
Firstly we have to initialize Git in the folder we work in. It means *"Creating Repository"*

##How to "Branch"
We can use different branches of Git to make kind of a *TreeView* of our repository. By the default we have one branch named "master"
To check where are we currently situated, we whould:
* Type **Git Branch** 

To reach the *TreeView* firstly we should make another branch, then we should:
* Type **Git Branch "*Branch_name*"**  

To switch to our brant new branch we should just:
* Type **Git checkout "*Branch_name*"**

And to start commiting here, do:
* Type **Git add *filename.xx*** 

then as usual

* Type **Git commit -m *"your message to commit"***- to finally create your commit in the branch
##How to Merge
After we worked in several branches, we might want to merge all them up in the common place. This place is branch called *"Master"* so we should go there:
* **Type Git checkout master**
* Type **Git merge "*Branch_name*"** - where **Branch_name** is the branch you want to include in the master branch. 
##How to Delete
To get rid of unnececcary trash out of your code, we should clean things up after merging. So simply delete the branch that was finished and merged into the master branch
* Type **Git branch -d "*Branch_name*"** - this branch will be deleted.
